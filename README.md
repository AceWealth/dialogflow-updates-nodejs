# Actions on Google: Updates API sample using Node.js and Cloud Functions for Firebase

This sample shows an app that gives tips about developing apps for the Google Assistant
using Actions on Google.

## Setup Instructions

### Steps
1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click *Create Project*.
1. Scroll down to the *More Options* section, and click on the *Conversational* card.
1. On the left navigation menu under *BUILD*, click on *Actions*. Click on *Add Your First Action* and choose your app's language(s).
1. Select *Custom intent*, click *BUILD*. This will open a Dialogflow console. Click *CREATE*.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `AoG-Tips.zip` file in this repo.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/actions.googleapis.com/overview) to activate the Actions API, and select the project that you have created on the Actions on Google console. Then, click the *Enable* button.

1. Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and select the project that you have created on the Actions on Google console.
1. Click the gear icon, then select *Project settings* > *SERVICE ACCOUNTS*.
1. Generate a new private key and save it in the `functions` folder calling the file `service-account.json`.
1. On the left navigation menu under *DEVELOP*, click on *Database*.
1. Under *Cloud Firebase Beta*, click *Get Started*.
1. Select *Start in test mode*, click *Enable*.

1. In the `functions` directory, deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the functions folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/):
   1. Follow the instructions to [set up and initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set_up_and_initialize_functions_sdk). Make sure to select the project that you have previously generated in the Actions on Google Console and to reply `N` when asked to overwrite existing files by the Firebase CLI.
   1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   1. Run `firebase deploy` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL (aogTips): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT}.cloudfunctions.net/aogTips`
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the `Function URL` from the previous step, then click *Save*.

1. To add tips to the newly created Firestore database, load in a browser `https://${REGION}-${PROJECT}.cloudfunctions.net/restoreTipsDB`.
1. Go to the [Actions on Google console](https://console.actions.google.com).
1. Follow the *Console Setup* instructions in the [Daily Updates](https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant/updates/daily) and the [Push Notifications](https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant/updates/notifications) documentation to enable daily updates and push notifications.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
1. To test daily updates, choose a category. After the tip, the app will show a suggestion chip to subscribe for daily updates.
1. To test push notifications, choose to hear the latest tip. After the top, the app will show
a suggestion chip to subscribe for push notifications. Add a new tip to the Firestore DB to trigger a notification to the subscribed users.
